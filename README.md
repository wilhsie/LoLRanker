Once upon a time I played around with appcelerator and Riot Games League of Legends API.

The goal was to learn how to keep promises (async calls) and handle lots of JSON.
To do this I thought it'd be a good idea to make an app that checks if a given user (summoner)
is in game, and returns the list of opponents including their stats.

Here you can find the controllers for that project.
